    section_name: "Whole-brain Streamline Counts"
    description: |
      This section contains whole-brain streamline counts for all subjects. If you ran the tracking only profile, the streamline count reflects the unfiltered number of streamline
      following tractography. If you selected the connectomics profile, this count will reflect the number of streamline following filtering with COMMIT. You can use this value to
      perform a sanity check on the quality of the tractography and flags potential outliers. Subjects with too low or too high streamline counts may have had some issues during
      processing or filtering. Refer to the individual subject reports for more details (found in the subject's output directory).

    section_name: "Maximum Framewise Displacement (FD)"
    description: |
      This section contains the maximum Framewise Displacement (FD) values for all subjects. The FD is a measure of head motion during the diffusion MRI acquisition and is computed during
      the eddy current correction step. High FD values indicate significant head motion, which can negatively impact the quality of the diffusion data and subsequent analyses. It is
      recommended to visually inspect subjects with high FD values to assess the impact of motion on the data quality. Refer to the individual subject reports for more details (found
      in the subject's output directory).

    section_name: "Quality Assessment of the Tractogram's White Matter Coverage (DICE Score)"
    description: |
      This section contains the DICE score for all subjects. The DICE score is a measure of the overlap between two segmentations or masks. In the context of this pipeline, the DICE
      was computed between the tracking mask and the Track Density Image (TDI) mask extracted from the whole-brain tractogram. The DICE score can be used to assess how well the tracking
      covers the white matter found in the tracking mask. A DICE score of 1 indicates a perfect overlap, meaning a perfect coverage of the white matter, while a lower DICE score indicates
      a lower coverage. Usually, a DICE score above 0.8 is considered acceptable. Subjects with lower DICE score may have had some issues during processing or filtering. Refer to the
      individual subject reports for more details (found in the subject's output directory).

  subcortical_volumes:
    file_format: "tsv"
    section_name: "Subcortical Parcellations Volumes"
    description: |
      This section contains subcortical parcellations volumes for all subjects. The volumes are extracted from either the FreeSurfer Recon-All pipeline or from the FastSurfer pipeline.
      The subcortical parcellations volumes are useful to assess the volume of the subcortical structures and can be used to detect potential abnormalities. Subjects with either too low or
      too high subcortical volumes may have had some issues during segmentation resulting in a bad segmentation quality. As a recommendation, outliers should be visually inspected to confirm
      the quality of the segmentation. Refer to the individual subject reports for more details (found in the subject's output directory).
