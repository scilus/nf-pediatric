    section_name: "Shell QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the diffusion shell, displaying
      the distribution of b-vectors on the sphere. This visualization ensures
      that the diffusion-weighted gradient directions are correctly assigned
      and evenly distributed, which is critical for accurate modeling of
      diffusion properties. To assess the quality of the b-vectors, check that
      the gradient directions form a uniform and symmetric distribution on
      the sphere, corresponding to the expected acquisition scheme (e.g.,
      single-shell, multi-shell). Look for missing or misaligned directions,
      which may indicate acquisition or preprocessing errors.

    section_name: "Eddy QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for EDDY correction, which is used to
      correct distortions and motion artifacts. The animation shows a
      before-and-after comparison of the correction. To assess the quality of
      the correction, focus on areas prone to distortions, such as the frontal
      lobe and the cerebellum/spinal cord region. Look for reduced geometric warping,
      improved alignment with anatomical boundaries, and correction of
      eddy-current-induced displacements. Additionally, ensure that no new
      artifacts or excessive blurring are introduced in the corrected images.

  fd_qc:
    file_format: "csv"
    section_name: "Framewise Displacement (FD) QC"
    description: |
      This section contains the Framewise Displacement (FD) values calculated
      during EDDY correction. FD is a measure of head motion between successive
      volumes in the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) time series. To assess
      motion quality, examine the FD values for spikes or consistently high
      values, which may indicate significant head movement during the scan.
      High FD values can lead to artifacts and reduced data quality, potentially
      impacting downstream analyses. Consider setting a threshold (e.g., 0.5 mm)
      to identify volumes with excessive motion that may need to be excluded
      from further analysis.

    section_name: "Topup QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for TOPUP correction, which is used to correct
      susceptibility-induced distortions by leveraging pairs of images acquired with
      opposite phase-encoding directions. The animation shows a before-and-after
      comparison of the correction. To assess the quality of the correction, focus
      on regions most affected by susceptibility distortions, such as the frontal lobe
      and the cerebellum/spinal cord area. Look for improved alignment of anatomical
      structures, reduced stretching or compression, and better symmetry between the
      corrected images. Additionally, ensure that the correction does not introduce
      new artifacts or excessive blurring.

  coregistration_qc:
    file_format: "gif"
    section_name: "Anatomical Coregistration"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the coregistration of the T1-weighted and
      T2-weighted structural images. To assess the quality of the coregistration,
      check for good alignment of anatomical structures. Specifically, look for
      proper overlay of cortical and subcortical structures without excessive
      warping, stretching, or misalignment. Pay particular attention to
      boundaries such as the ventricles. If misalignment is present, consider
      flagging this specific subject for further review.

    section_name: "Registration of anatomical image in DWI space QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the T1-weighted
      structural image to diffusion space, using the b0 image as a reference.
      This step ensures accurate alignment between structural and diffusion
      data. To assess the quality of the registration, check for good alignment
      of anatomical structures. Specifically, look for proper overlay of cortical
      and subcortical structures without excessive warping, stretching,
      or misalignment. Pay particular attention to boundaries such as the
      ventricles and major white matter tracts, ensuring they match well
      between the T1-weighted and b0 images. If misalignment is present,
      consider flagging this specific subject for further review.

  templatetodwi_qc:
    file_format: "gif"
    section_name: "Registration of template in DWI space QC"
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the registration of the template (UNCInfant)
      to diffusion space, using the b0 image as a reference. This step ensures
      accurate alignment between the template and diffusion data. To assess
      the quality of the registration, check for good alignment of anatomical
      structures. Specifically, look for proper overlay of cortical and
      subcortical structures without excessive warping, stretching,
      or misalignment. Pay particular attention to boundaries such as the
      ventricles and major white matter tracts, ensuring they match well
      between the template and b0 images. If misalignment is present,
      consider flagging this specific subject for further review.

  tissue_segmentation_qc:
    file_format: "tsv"
    section_name: "Tissue Segmentation QC" # This is the new section name
    description: |
      This section contains images for visual quality control of tissue segmentation,
      where different tissue classes are color-coded: red for white matter (WM),
      green for gray matter (GM), and blue for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
      This segmentation is typically derived from a T1-weighted structural image
      (if pediatric) or T2-weighted structural image (infant) and is crucial for
      downstream analyses such as tractography. To assess the quality of the
      segmentation, ensure that each tissue class is well-defined and corresponds
      accurately to expected anatomical regions. White matter should be
      predominantly within deep brain structures and major tracts,
      gray matter should outline the cortex and subcortical nuclei, and
      CSF should primarily appear in the ventricles and surrounding sulci.
      Check for misclassifications, such as CSF incorrectly assigned within
      the brain or gray/white matter boundaries appearing blurred or inconsistent.
      If artifacts or misclassifications are present, consider flagging this specific
      for further review.

  metrics_qc:
    file_format: "tsv"
    section_name: "Metrics QC" # This is the new section name
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) metric maps and FODF metric maps, including fractional anisotropy
      (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), RGB FA, and number of fiber orientation (NuFO).
      To assess the quality of the DTI metrics, ensure that FA highlights major
      white matter tracts with expected high values (e.g., corpus callosum,
      corticospinal tract) and that MD, RGB FA, and NuFO values follow known
      anatomical distributions. Look for smooth, artifact-free maps, avoiding
      unexpected signal dropout, distortions, or excessive noise. Pay special
      attention to regions prone to artifacts, such as near the ventricles or
      areas affected by eddy currents and susceptibility distortions.
    plot_type: "image"
  tracking_qc:
    file_format: "tsv"
    section_name: "Tracking Coverage" # This is the new section name
    description: |
      This section contains QC images of tractography coverage, shown as an
      overlay of the tract density image (pink) with the WM mask (green).
      This visualization assesses how well
      the reconstructed streamlines cover the white matter mask used for
      tracking, with higher coverage generally indicating better results.
      To evaluate tracking quality, check that the tract density image spans
      the full extent of the white matter mask, ensuring that major pathways
      (e.g., corpus callosum, corticospinal tract) are well-represented.
      Ideally, the coverage should be uniform across the mask, with minimal
      gaps or missing regions. Areas of low coverage may indicate poor
      tracking due to insufficient diffusion signal, masking errors, or
      overly restrictive tracking parameters. Conversely, excessive streamlines
      outside the mask may suggest tracking leakage into non-white matter
      regions, requiring further filtering.

  labels_qc:
    file_format: "tsv"
    section_name: "Labels QC" # This is the new section name
    description: |
      This section contains QC images for the segmentation of
      cortical and subcortical structures, displayed as an overlay of
      anatomical labels. These labels are derived from structural MRI
      and serve as key regions of interest for connectivity analyses and
      volumetric measurements. To assess segmentation accuracy, verify
      that each label correctly corresponds to its respective anatomical
      structure. Cortical labels should align with gyri and follow natural
      sulcal boundaries, while subcortical labels should fit well within deep
      gray matter structures such as the thalamus and basal ganglia. Check for
      misalignments, incorrect label assignments, or excessive partial
      volume effects. If discrepancies are found, consider refining
      registration or segmentation parameters.
