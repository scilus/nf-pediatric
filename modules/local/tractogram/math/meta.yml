description: |
  This module performs mathematical operations on tractograms.
  It can be used to concatenate multiple tractograms into a single file,
  compute the union of multiple tractograms, or perform other operations.
  The available operations are:


  - Concatenate: Combine multiple tractograms into a single file.
  - Union: Compute the union of multiple tractograms.
  - Intersection: Compute the intersection of multiple tractograms.
  - Difference: Compute the difference between two tractograms.
  - Lazy Concatenate: Concatenate multiple tractograms without loading them into memory.
